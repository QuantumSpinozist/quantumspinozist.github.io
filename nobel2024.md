# Some Thoughts on the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics

## The Public Opinion

Since I was sick on the day of the announcement, I had a lot of time to read people’s opinions on Twitter and elsewhere. I have been actively following the Nobel Prize in Physics since about 2017, and I have never seen such strong disagreement with the committee’s decision from vast parts of the community. You can always find some people who are unhappy with the decision, but in previous years, those opinions were always quite fringe.

To give a quick rundown of my observations: I have read comments from people in the physics community, the ML community, and from the smaller intersection of both groups (so people mainly doing research on either ML for physics, physics for ML, or both). Take what I say with a medium-sized grain of salt since this is purely anecdotal; I have not done any quantitative analysis or polls or anything like that. In the ML community, my impression was that most people seemed very excited and happy, but there was also a large amount of ironic commentary and questioning if the designation as physics really made sense. In the physics community, the response was much less positive. Many people expressed disappointment with the prize not going to "real" physics, and many claimed the decision was driven by AI hype. Interestingly, within the third group, the response was by far the most positive. Especially people working in physics for ML seemed very enthusiastic about the Nobel committee’s decision to highlight the proximity of neural networks and statistical physics.

## Was the Decision Justified?

To judge whether any research contribution is worthy of a Nobel in Physics, we really need to ask two questions: Is the contribution significant enough? Is it physics enough?

To expand on the first question, one way to view this criterion is to say that a contribution should be deemed significant enough if it helped open up a new and important field of research or application or caused an all-encompassing change in an existing one. It should significantly change the life of a sufficient number of people (whether researchers or not). I do not claim that this is the only way to view this criterion, but it is a helpful one in this context. Let us take a cartoonishly easy example: the Physics Nobel of 1921, awarded to Einstein for the photoelectric effect. Einstein’s interpretation of the experiments completely changed how physicists viewed light. Pretty much every experimentalist doing research with light needed to take his ideas into account.

Now, let us look at this year’s award. The prize was explicitly given for Hopfield’s work on Hopfield networks and Hinton’s work on Boltzmann machines, but during the later presentation, there was also a lot of emphasis on the way ML has helped in physics research. Let’s start with the question of significance. I don’t think any critic of the decision would question that Machine Learning (or more precisely, the introduction of neural networks into AI) is significant enough to receive a Nobel overall. Now, if we compare this with the case of Einstein and the photoelectric effect, it’s clear that the group of people who contributed to the birth of the field is much larger. So, the question is: Who should be chosen? The Nobel committee apparently wanted to really focus on the foundations of neural networks, which is why they chose Hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines, even though these models are not used much today. This brings the question of significance back into focus. Are Hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines foundational milestones for the Deep Learning world of today? Or, to rephrase a question that was actually asked in the press conference: Would today’s AI exist without Hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines?

I think I can only echo the answer given by a member of the committee: it’s hard to say. I think it is uncontroversial that both inventions were important in the early history of neural networks in AI. But I am simply not enough of an expert in the history of AI to judge whether they are the definitive milestones.

Let’s move to the second criterion. So, what counts as physics? I think we should immediately reject the narrow definition of physics as being about the fundamental properties of matter and energy. This might have been true at some point in history, but today, many physicists' work is much broader. I would not argue that a physicist working on applications of statistical mechanics to traffic flow or other complex systems stops being a physicist and becomes something else entirely. Since both Hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines are really just a type of Ising model, they clearly count as works of statistical physics to me. Since Hopfield is by all accounts a physicist (not exclusively, of course), this designation is particularly easy in his case.

## Conclusion

I think if we look at MLPs or CNNs, few people would argue that these still count as physics, while diffusion models do take some inspiration from it. For transformers, it’s in some ways more difficult again due to their relation to modern Hopfield nets. Since the prize was specifically given for Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines, the question of significance is really the more difficult one, in my opinion. From what I know about AI history, I think their impact on the field is big enough, but I can also see the other side of the argument.

In the following discussions, many people emphasized the impact of ML overall on physics. While I agree that said impact is immense, I think this is not key to the question of whether the awarding of the prize was justified in this case. If there was a Nobel for ML for physics, and I think it is quite likely we will see one in the future, it will go to people who actually worked on that specifically (compare it to the Nobel given to AlphaFold the next day).

Overall, I personally really liked the decision. I think it is good if the committee tries to go for important researchers beyond the more conventional choices. I really view it as a great opportunity to celebrate the connections between physics and ML (in both directions), in the same way that the Nobel for AlphaFold was one to celebrate those between chemistry or biology and ML.
