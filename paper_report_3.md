## Introduction

## Problem statement

We are given and i.i.d. dataset $$ \{ x^{i} \}_{i=0, ..., N}$$ that where $$x$$ is generated by a latent variable $$z$$ in dependence of the parameter vector $$\theta $$ via

$$z \sim p_{\theta^*}(z),\\ x|z \sim p_{\theta^*}(x|z).$$

Both PDFs are assumed to be differentiable in $$z$$ and $$\theta$$ almost everywhere.
