# Paper Report 9: Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition

## Introduction

I reimplemented this paper over on my github ([https://github.com/QuantumSpinozist/One-Shot-Image-Recognition](One-Shot-Image-Recognition)).

I personally find few and one shot learning really interesting. For many applications, having very few data points available is more the norm than
the opposite, so trying to get the most out of your small amount data is both theoretically and practically interesting. One shot learning pushes this to
a provisional limit (zero shot learning shall be somewhat excluded as it usually works quite differently). In a time with more and more powerful
foundation models in many domains, few short tasks become more and more feasible. This paper comes from before those developments, but it presents
a general blueprint for how to solve one shot tasks by learning a metric. This basic idea is still present in many recent models (like CLIP for example).
