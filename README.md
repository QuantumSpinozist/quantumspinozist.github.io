## Paper Report 1: Does Knowledge Distillation Really Work?
I want to write to start writing small reports on papers I have recently read. The purpose is roughly two fold, obviously
this helps me to collect my thoughts and will ideally (if I stick to it) provide a nice way to get some overview over interesting articles.
More importantly I have noticed that I will read papers in a much more fruitful way if I have an actual task in connection to my reading (like writing a short summary).
I do not aim to report on every paper I read, not even necessarily the ones I enjoyed the most, just the ones where I felt like it for whatever reason.
These reports will mostly try to summarize the articles, but I also want to provide my own commentary in some sense.
