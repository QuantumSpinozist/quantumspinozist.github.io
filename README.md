### Book Report: The Principles of Deep Learning Theory - Part 1, Neural Networks at Initialization
<img src="docs/assets/images/roberts_p1.png" width="600"/>
I recently finished reading "The Principles of Deep Learning Theory: An Effective Theory Approach to Understanding Neural Networks" by Roberts and Yaida.
The book uses tools from statistical mechanics and field theory as an holistic approach to Deep Learning theory. As my original background is in theoretical physics (specifically theoretical statistical physics)
this was highly intriguing to me. The field of Deep Learning theory is really just in its infancy and there is a lot of research coming in from different angles, using different theoretical and experimental tools.
The books style is one interesting addition to this mix.

The book does not make this explicit but it can be split into two parts relatively nicely. The first part studies MLPs with weights at gaussian initialization, while the second part deals with learning.
I will write one article per part.

### Paper Report 3: Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes
<img src="docs/assets/images/paper_3.png" width="1000"/>
I would like to cover some classic papers in this series, starting with the discovery (or invention, whichever you prefer) of the Variational Autoencoder by Diederik P. Kingma and Max Welling in 2013.

This paper presents a novel active learning method designed to drastically reduce the number of annotated frames required for video action detection.

### Paper Report 1: Does Knowledge Distillation Really Work?
<img src="docs/assets/images/paper_1.png" width="1000"/>
I want to start writing small reports on papers I have recently read (not necessarily new ones). The purpose is twofold: first, it will help me organize my thoughts, and ideally (if I stick to it), provide a nice overview of interesting articles. More importantly, I’ve noticed that I engage with papers in a much more meaningful way when I have an actual task connected to my reading, like writing a short summary.

I don't aim to report on every paper I read, or even necessarily the ones I enjoyed the most—just the ones that made an impression on me for whatever reason. These reports will mostly summarize the articles, but I also want to include my own commentary and reflections where relevant.

## Miscellaneous

### Some thoughts on the 2024 Nobel prize in physics
<img src="docs/assets/images/2024nobel.jpg" width="600"/>

As most people probably know the Nobel prize in physics was awarded to Hinton and Hopfield this year. This has sparked quite some controversy in both the physics and
the machine learning community. As someone with a background in statistical physics who is currently in the process of getting a graduate degree in machine learning, I feel like
I am in a somewhat unique position to comment on this. This short article is not supposed to give any definitive answer to the question whether or not the commitees decision was justified,
I just want to present my thoughts in a structured manner.

### The Bean Problem - A probabilistic Shower Thought
This is perhaps a rather strange entry but I recently stumbled upon a little exercise in probability theory while cooking.
