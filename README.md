I would like to cover some classic papers in this series, starting with the discovery (or invention, whichever you prefer) of the Variational Autoencoder by Diederik P. Kingma and Max Welling in 2013.

### Paper Report 1: Does Knowledge Distillation Really Work?
<img src="docs/assets/images/paper_1.png" width="1000"/>
I want to start writing small reports on papers I have recently read (not necessarily new ones). The purpose is twofold: first, it will help me organize my thoughts, and ideally (if I stick to it), provide a nice overview of interesting articles. More importantly, I’ve noticed that I engage with papers in a much more meaningful way when I have an actual task connected to my reading, like writing a short summary.

I don't aim to report on every paper I read, or even necessarily the ones I enjoyed the most—just the ones that made an impression on me for whatever reason. These reports will mostly summarize the articles, but I also want to include my own commentary and reflections where relevant.

### The Bean Problem - A probabilistic Shower Thought
This is perhaps a rather strange entry but i recently stumbled upon a little exercise in probability theory while cooking.
