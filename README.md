### Paper Report 1: Does Knowledge Distillation Really Work?
I want to start writing small reports on papers I have recently read (not necessarily new ones). The purpose is twofold: first, it will help me organize my thoughts, and ideally (if I stick to it), provide a nice overview of interesting articles. More importantly, I’ve noticed that I engage with papers in a much more meaningful way when I have an actual task connected to my reading, like writing a short summary.

I don't aim to report on every paper I read, or even necessarily the ones I enjoyed the most—just the ones that made an impression on me for whatever reason. These reports will mostly summarize the articles, but I also want to include my own commentary and reflections where relevant.
